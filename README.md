**IMPORTANT:** The source of truth for repositories is now [Forgejo](https://git.farthergate.com/); GitHub has lost my trust. See backups of all repositories here at <https://git.farthergate.com/gh>.

# :wave: Hello!
My name is Aleks Rutins. I enjoy coding, reading, skiing, and deployments that don't fail.

**Looking for something?** I'm trying to [give up GitHub](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/) ([update: more reasons!](https://www.theverge.com/news/757461/microsoft-github-thomas-dohmke-resignation-coreai-team-transition)), so it's quite possibly over at [Forgejo](https://git.farthergate.com) or [SourceHut](https://sr.ht/~aleksrutins).
