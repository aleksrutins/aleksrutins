**IMPORTANT:** Most new repositories are now on [SourceHut](https://sr.ht/~aleksrutins).

# :wave: Hello!
My name is Aleks Rutins. I enjoy coding, reading, skiing, and deployments that don't fail.

**Looking for something?** I'm trying to [give up GitHub](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/) ([update: more reasons!](https://www.theverge.com/news/757461/microsoft-github-thomas-dohmke-resignation-coreai-team-transition)), so it's quite possibly over at [SourceHut](https://sr.ht/~aleksrutins).
